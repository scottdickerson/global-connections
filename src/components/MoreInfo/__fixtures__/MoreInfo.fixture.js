        "Japan attacked the Philippine Islands on December 8, 1941, the day after bombing the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. The Filipino and American forces, most without combat experience, attempted to defend the Philippines. The defenders were overwhelmed. Douglas MacArthur, commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, pulled back to the Bataan Peninsula, on the east coast of Luzon Island. When the Japanese took Bataan, about 66,000 Filipino and 10,000 American soldiers became prisoners of war. On April 9, 1942, the Japanese began the forced removal of prisoners of war from the Bataan Peninsula. The grueling 60-mile march to a new camp became known as the Bataan Death March. On May 6, the last of American and Filipino forces fighting in the Philippines became prisoners of war when Corregidor Island was surrendered to the Japanese. Harrison County soldiers were among those taken prisoner by the Japanese on Bataan and Corregidor. <strong>Cary M. Abney Jr.</strong> was serving at Clark Field on Luzon Island when the Japanese captured the Philippines. His family was first notified that he was missing in action. They learned he survived, but was part of the brutal Bataan Death March and died while a prisoner of war. Abney, a graduate of Texas A&amp;M and a captain, was among the first Army Reserve units activated in the lead up to World War II. His field artillery unit arrived in the Philippines three months before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. While a prisoner of war, Abney wrote in a small notebook the names and addresses of more than 220 officers, soldiers and airmen with dates of death and other information. He worried their families would not know what happened to them. Abney copied the information into a second notebook. He gave the original to Eligio E. Fuerte, a Filipino he met in POW camp, to send home after the war. On December 13, 1944, before boarding the <em>Oryoku Maru</em>, a commercial cargo transport ship used to move prisoners of war to Japan, Abney gave the copy of his notebook to Chester Sanders (husband of Marshall native, Millie Brown Sanders) with instructions written on the first page of the notebook to return the book to friends in Marshall. At the top of page 24 of the notebook was a large X beside Fuente's name. Abney wrote, ”This Philippino has given me food at a time when I needed it the worst! If I do not return, he should be rewarded. I think a suit and new shoes should do.&quot; In December 1945, Abney's father sent Fuente $100 with a letter expressing his gratitude for helping his son. With U.S. forces about to retake the islands in 1944, the Japanese began moving the prisoners closer to Japan. Abney, Jack Kelly, and Thomas Austin were on the same transport ship, the <em>Oryoku Maru</em>, when Allied forces attacked the unmarked ship. Kelly died in the attack. Abney and Austin survived and were moved to a second transport ship, the <em>Enoura Maru</em>. Abney and Austin were wounded during the bombing of this ship and were on a third ship, the <em>Brazil Maru</em>, when they both died on January 28, 1945. When Abney's wife, Thelma, learned that her husband was missing in action in May 1942, she was moved to do more to support the war effort and joined the Women's Army Corp. <strong>Thomas Underwood Austin</strong>, a second lieutenant with the U.S. Army field artillery, was assigned to the Philippines four months before the outbreak of the war with Japan. He was stationed about 40 miles from Manila with an anti-aircraft battery and became a prisoner of war after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor. As the Japanese began moving some prisoners to the Japanese mainland in late 1944, Austin was aboard the <em>Oryoku Maru</em> and it was reported he died aboard this ship. A later report said he died aboard the <em>Brazil Maru</em> on January 28, 1945. These Japanese cargo transport ships, converted to prisoner transports, became known as &quot;Hell Ships&quot; because of the inhumane conditions and cruelty of the crew. Austin, along with an estimated 500 other prisoners, died on the <em>Brazil Maru</em> before the ship reached the destination in Japan on January 29. <strong>Billy Alvin Ayers</strong> enlisted in the Army Air Corps in May 1941. The Army private celebrated his 18th birthday at Manila, Luzon Island, Philippines when his unit was transferred there in October 1941. He was taken prisoner on April 9, 1942. Ayers' family did not know his fate until January 1945 when his father received a prisoner of war card with the news that Ayers was in Fukuoka Furyoshuyosho prison camp in Japan. The 1,700 prisoners in the camp were forced to work in a dangerous coal mine. More than 1,400 had broken bones from accidents and many did not survive. American forces liberated the camp on September 5, 1945. Private Ayers gave sworn testimony on camp conditions that was widely reported in newspapers and used in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. <strong>Edwin Barry</strong> enlisted in the Army as a private in World War I. In 1940, he was stationed in the Philippines. Barry was reported missing May 29, 1942 soon after U.S. forces lost the Battle of Corregidor. In 1946, his family learned he was captured on Corregidor and died from malaria while in a prisoner of war camp on Luzon Island, Philippines. &quot;I have lost a gallant comrade,&quot; Gen. Douglas MacArthur wrote in a personal letter to Barry's mother. &quot;You may have some consolation in the memory that he, along with his comrades-in-arms...gave his life for his country,&quot; MacArthur wrote. Barry was posthumously promoted to colonel and awarded a Legion of Merit medal. <strong>Thomas E. Belch</strong>, a staff sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps, was captured by the Japanese in May 1945 after the fall of Corregidor Island. His father was mayor of Waskom. Belch was sent to Kawasaki POW Camp Branch #2 in Tokyo, Japan where he was held with over 400 other prisoners of war until October 1945. They were forced to work in factories and shipping yards. Belch also served in the Korean War. <strong>Lewis B. Chevaillier</strong> served as a lieutenant with Battery B, 60th Coast Artillery Regiment (Anti-Aircraft). He was awarded a Silver Star for his brave actions during the battle for Corregidor in May 1942. During the battle, several men were severely wounded and left lying in an exposed position. Although the shelling continued without interruption, Chevaillier, with no thought of personal safety, voluntarily left his covered position and assisted in evacuating the wounded men to a first aid station several hundred yards distant. He survived the battle, but was captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned at Zentsuji Camp, Japan until his liberation in 1945. Later, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. <strong>Harry C. Ford</strong> was 24 when he was captured as Corregidor fell to the Japanese. The U.S. Army corporal was imprisoned in the Osaka Main Camp, Japan. Prisoners in this camp were forced to work as stevedores or dockworkers for Japanese companies at Osaka Port. The POWs loaded and unloaded ships and railcars, transported materials, and worked in warehouses at the docks. They were not given enough food. A sample day's ration was rice and soup for breakfast, bread and seaweed for lunch, and rice and soup for dinner. Every 10 days the prisoners would be given fish, and meat less often. Ford's parents received a telegram with the good news that their son, now a sergeant, was liberated from prisoner of war camp on September 11, 1945. <strong>Jack W. Kelly</strong> entered the Army Air Corps on July 31, 1941. Kelly arrived in the Philippines in August 1941 serving with the 7th Materiel Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group. Stationed at Clark Field, near Manila on Luzon Island, the captain was made commanding officer of his squadron when the commander died in the Japanese attack on December 8. After Clark Field was evacuated to the Bataan Peninsula, he was first reported missing in action when the Japanese seized Bataan. Kelly was actually in prisoner of war camps in the Philippines, Camp O'Donnell and Cabanatuan, where he wrote a letter on December 13, 1944 to his wife telling her that he was being moved to Japan. He died December 15, 1944 in the attack on the prisoner of war transport ship, the <em>Oryoku Maru.</em> <strong>Herschel N. Walle</strong>r became a prisoner of war when the Japanese took Corregidor. He was serving as a private with the 27th Bombardment Group, Army Air Corps. Waller's wife, Delphine was living in Waskom when, 15 months after he was reported missing in action, she received a card through the International Red Cross telling her Waller was in a prisoner of war camp in the Philippines. In the fall of 1945 when Sendai No. 7-B POW Camp in Tokyo, Japan was liberated, Waller was one of the prisoners. He was one of 240 Americans and 40 Australians forced to work in a copper mine. Working conditions were dangerous and mistreatment a daily occurrence. Waller said that the POWs were put in 10-man work groups. They were told by their captors that if one man did something wrong the rest would be killed. In September 1945, Delphine received a cablegram with the news her husband was liberated.
