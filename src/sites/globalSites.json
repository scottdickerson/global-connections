The 1st Mississippi participated in battles at Monterrey and Buena Vista, Mexico. Entering service as a private, Greer was promoted to major general of the Mississippi militia soon after the war ended. Jefferson Davis would later become president of the Confederate States of America. In 1848, Greer settled in Marshall and two years later married Anna Holcombe at Wyalucing, the Beverly and Eugenia Holcombe plantation home west of Marshall. Anna was the sister of Lucy Holcomb Pickens, who became known as the \"Queen of the Confederacy.\" Greer was a merchant, a planter, and a lawyer. In May 1861, soon after the Civil War began, he was issued a colonel's commission in the Confederate States Army and ordered to recruit 1,000 soldiers. By June, he had enlisted volunteers from across east Texas. They mustered into the Confederate Army as the 3rd Texas Cavalry Regiment. With Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch's Army of the West, he commanded his regiment at the battles of Wilson's Creek, Missouri and Chustenahlah, Indian Territory. At Pea Ridge, Arkansas, Greer's arm was severely wounded and he resigned his command on June 1, 1862. Greer later returned to service and in June 1863 was commissioned a brigadier general. He was assigned Commandant of Conscripts for the Trans-Mississippi Department, a subdivision of the Confederate States west of the Mississippi. The Trans-Mississippi headquarters were at Shreveport, Louisiana and Marshall. After the war, Greer continued his career as a merchant and a planter in Harrison County. \n\nSources: HCHM Archive; Handbook of Texas Online, Carolyn Hyman, \"Greer, Elkanah Bracken;\" The Third Texas Cavalry in the Civil War, Douglas Hale."

A native of New Orleans, Clark moved from Montgomery, Alabama to Marshall in December 1841 and opened a law practice. Clark served as a delegate to the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1845 and then as a congressman and senator in the Texas legislature. He served on the staff of General James Pinckney Henderson in the Mexican-American War, and received a citation for bravery in the Battle of Monterrey. From 1853 to 1857, Clark was Texas secretary of state. He was elected lieutenant governor of Texas on the ticket headed by Sam Houston in 1859. When Texas voted to join the Confederate States of America in February 1861, Sam Houston refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy and was removed from office. Clark became governor of Confederate Texas. As governor, he focused on raising troops and gathering supplies to assist in the war of the Confederacy against the U.S. In the fall of 1861, he lost the governor's race by 124 votes. Clark joined the Confederate army's 14th Regiment, which served with Walker's Texas Division. He was commissioned as a colonel and then promoted to brigadier general after being wounded when leading an attack during battle at Pleasant Hill, Louisiana in April 1864. He fled briefly to Mexico at the end of the Civil War with other Confederates, but returned home to Marshall. Sources: HCHM Archive; Handbook of Texas Online, Ralph A. Wooster, \"Clark, Edward.\""

The 103 men from Harrison, Marion, and Upshur counties named their company after Walter Paye Lane, a Marshall war veteran famous for his service in the Texas Revolution and in the Mexican-American War. The Rangers were ordered to San Antonio where they camped in the shadow of the Alamo. On May 9, they saw U.S. troops evacuating the Texas frontier and soon learned that they were to take their place. Even after the Rangers mustered into the Confederate Army as Company F, 2nd Regiment of the Texas Mounted Rifles, the group continued to refer to themselves as the W.P. Lane Rangers. They served for nearly a year on the frontier moving from Camp Wood to Fort Inge and Fort Clark, and finally, to Fort Lancaster. Joseph Norris, a young farmer who recently moved to Marshall from Georgia, died of pneumonia. His friend, William Heartsill, carefully carved his original headstone and wrote to the Marshall newspaper of the loss: \"...scarce had we reached here [Fort Lancaster], ere one of our number sickened and died, Joseph H.

Hood's Texas Brigade was known as one of the most effective fighting units in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia that fought in the Eastern Theater of the war. In September 1862, Bass was promoted to major, and in January 1864, to lieutenant colonel. Then in July, he was promoted to colonel and given the overall command of the 1st Texas Infantry Regiment. On April 9, 1865, Bass surrendered along with the rest of Lee's army to Ulysses S. Grant and the United States Army at Appomattox Courthouse, Virginia. Bass surrendered 16 officers and 133 soldiers. Soon after this surrender, the four-year American Civil War officially ended. Bass was born in 1831 in Virginia and graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1851. Before the Civil War, he moved to Marshall and taught at Marshall University, an academy for boys. After the war, Bass again served as the president of Marshall University.

His career as a citizen soldier in national guard units continued for 45 years. In March 1916, the Mexican Revolution was underway. Spurred by events in this 10-year civil war, revolutionary leader General Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa's forces attacked the camp of a U.S. Army cavalry regiment in New Mexico. General John Pershing was then appointed commander of a U.S. Army expeditionary force charged with capturing Villa and policing the U.S.-Mexico border. This was the beginning of year long search for Villa. In 1916, Pershing with more than 50,000 soldiers crossed the Mexican border in an attempt to subdue Villa. The 3rd Texas Infantry was activated and joined Pershing at the Texas border. Rains, now a colonel, was commanding officer of the 3rd Texas, which included many Harrison County guardsmen. Pershing returned to the United States without capturing Villa. The U.S. entered World War I in 1917. Rains was again called to active duty with the 36th Infantry Division. He was assigned as commanding officer of the 36th Military Police and the 61st Pioneer Infantry. In 1936, now a lieutenant general, Rains retired from the national guard and was made honorary life president of the 36th Division. Born in Marshall in 1872, the son of Mercer and Nancy Texas (Arnett) Rains, he received a medical degree from the University of Texas and was a physician in Harrison County. Rains was honored nationally as a doctor and as a military man. Sources: Handbook of Texas Online, Christopher Long, \"George Perry Rains;\" HCHM Archive."

That same year he graduated with the first officer's training class at Leon Springs, Texas as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. These young officers became known as the \"90-Day Wonders,\" because they completed their training in only three months. Adams went on to serve in World War I with the 90th Infantry Division in Europe. He returned to active duty in 1942 during World War II and was stationed in Puerto Rico. The early years of World War II demonstrated the importance of protecting the shipping lines through the Caribbean Sea to the southern United States and Central and South America. German U-boat crews had already sunk over a million tons of United States and Allied supplies and petroleum. Puerto Rico was chosen as the base of operations to protect the Caribbean. By 1943, there were over 50,000 U.S. military personnel serving around the island on Army, Army Air Forces and Navy bases. In 1940, when Germany attacked Great Britain, the United States feared that if Germany controlled Great Britain, then Mexico and the United States would be next. In the same year, President Roosevelt ordered the construction of a naval base in the Atlantic similar to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. A site near Ceiba, in northeast Puerto Rico, was chosen for the new naval base. The site was meant to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60 percent of the Atlantic Fleet. Named to honor Franklin D. Roosevelt, the U.S. Naval Base Roosevelt Roads, became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass. Adams, who served 33 years in the U.S. Army, retired in May 1953 at the rank of colonel and returned to the land settled by his Adams family in 1841 in Marshall.

    "learnMore": "Japan attacked the Philippine Islands on December 8, 1941, the day after bombing the American naval base at Pearl Harbor. The Filipino and American forces, most without combat experience, attempted to defend the Philippines. The defenders were overwhelmed. Douglas MacArthur, commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, pulled back to the Bataan Peninsula, on the east coast of Luzon Island. When the Japanese took Bataan, about 66,000 Filipino and 10,000 American soldiers became prisoners of war. On April 9, 1942, the Japanese began the forced removal of prisoners of war from the Bataan Peninsula. The grueling 60-mile march to a new camp became known as the Bataan Death March. On May 6, the last of American and Filipino forces fighting in the Philippines became prisoners of war when Corregidor Island was surrendered to the Japanese. Harrison County soldiers were among those taken prisoner by the Japanese on Bataan and Corregidor. **Cary M. Abney Jr.** was serving at Clark Field on Luzon Island when the Japanese captured the Philippines. His family was first notified that he was missing in action. They learned he survived, but was part of the brutal Bataan Death March and died while a prisoner of war. Abney, a graduate of Texas A&M and a captain, was among the first Army Reserve units activated in the lead up to World War II. His field artillery unit arrived in the Philippines three months before the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. While a prisoner of war, Abney wrote in a small notebook the names and addresses of more than 220 officers, soldiers and airmen with dates of death and other information. He worried their families would not know what happened to them. Abney copied the information into a second notebook. He gave the original to Eligio E. Fuerte, a Filipino he met in POW camp, to send home after the war. On December 13, 1944, before boarding the <i>Oryoku Maru</i>, a commercial cargo transport ship used to move prisoners of war to Japan, Abney gave the copy of his notebook to Chester Sanders (husband of Marshall native, Millie Brown Sanders) with instructions written on the first page of the notebook to return the book to friends in Marshall. At the top of page 24 of the notebook was a large X beside Fuente's name. Abney wrote, \"This Philippino has given me food at a time when I needed it the worst! If I do not return, he should be rewarded. I think a suit and new shoes should do.\" In December 1945, Abney's father sent Fuente $100 with a letter expressing his gratitude for helping his son. With U.S. forces about to retake the islands in 1944, the Japanese began moving the prisoners closer to Japan. Abney, Jack Kelly, and Thomas Austin were on the same transport ship, the *Oryoku Maru*, when Allied forces attacked the unmarked ship. Kelly died in the attack. Abney and Austin survived and were moved to a second transport ship, the *Enoura Maru*. Abney and Austin were wounded during the bombing of this ship and were on a third ship, the *Brazil Maru*, when they both died on January 28, 1945. When Abney's wife, Thelma, learned that her husband was missing in action in May 1942, she was moved to do more to support the war effort and joined the Women's Army Corp. **Thomas Underwood Austin**, a second lieutenant with the U.S. Army field artillery, was assigned to the Philippines four months before the outbreak of the war with Japan. He was stationed about 40 miles from Manila with an anti-aircraft battery and became a prisoner of war after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor. As the Japanese began moving some prisoners to the Japanese mainland in late 1944, Austin was aboard the *Oryoku Maru* and it was reported he died aboard this ship. A later report said he died aboard the *Brazil Maru* on January 28, 1945. These Japanese cargo transport ships, converted to prisoner transports, became known as \"Hell Ships\" because of the inhumane conditions and cruelty of the crew. Austin, along with an estimated 500 other prisoners, died on the *Brazil Maru* before the ship reached the destination in Japan on January 29. **Billy Alvin Ayers** enlisted in the Army Air Corps in May 1941. The Army private celebrated his 18th birthday at Manila, Luzon Island, Philippines when his unit was transferred there in October 1941. He was taken prisoner on April 9, 1942. Ayers' family did not know his fate until January 1945 when his father received a prisoner of war card with the news that Ayers was in Fukuoka Furyoshuyosho prison camp in Japan. The 1,700 prisoners in the camp were forced to work in a dangerous coal mine. More than 1,400 had broken bones from accidents and many did not survive. American forces liberated the camp on September 5, 1945. Private Ayers gave sworn testimony on camp conditions that was widely reported in newspapers and used in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal. **Edwin Barry** enlisted in the Army as a private in World War I. In 1940, he was stationed in the Philippines. Barry was reported missing May 29, 1942 soon after U.S. forces lost the Battle of Corregidor. In 1946, his family learned he was captured on Corregidor and died from malaria while in a prisoner of war camp on Luzon Island, Philippines. \"I have lost a gallant comrade,\" Gen. Douglas MacArthur wrote in a personal letter to Barry's mother. \"You may have some consolation in the memory that he, along with his comrades-in-arms...gave his life for his country,\" MacArthur wrote. Barry was posthumously promoted to colonel and awarded a Legion of Merit medal. **Thomas E. Belch**, a staff sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps, was captured by the Japanese in May 1945 after the fall of Corregidor Island. His father was mayor of Waskom. Belch was sent to Kawasaki POW Camp Branch #2 in Tokyo, Japan where he was held with over 400 other prisoners of war until October 1945. They were forced to work in factories and shipping yards. Belch also served in the Korean War. **Lewis B. Chevaillier** served as a lieutenant with Battery B, 60th Coast Artillery Regiment (Anti-Aircraft). He was awarded a Silver Star for his brave actions during the battle for Corregidor in May 1942. During the battle, several men were severely wounded and left lying in an exposed position. Although the shelling continued without interruption, Chevaillier, with no thought of personal safety, voluntarily left his covered position and assisted in evacuating the wounded men to a first aid station several hundred yards distant. He survived the battle, but was captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned at Zentsuji Camp, Japan until his liberation in 1945. Later, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. **Harry C. Ford** was 24 when he was captured as Corregidor fell to the Japanese. The U.S. Army corporal was imprisoned in the Osaka Main Camp, Japan. Prisoners in this camp were forced to work as stevedores or dockworkers for Japanese companies at Osaka Port. The POWs loaded and unloaded ships and railcars, transported materials, and worked in warehouses at the docks. They were not given enough food. A sample day's ration was rice and soup for breakfast, bread and seaweed for lunch, and rice and soup for dinner. Every 10 days the prisoners would be given fish, and meat less often. Ford's parents received a telegram with the good news that their son, now a sergeant, was liberated from prisoner of war camp on September 11, 1945. **Jack W. Kelly** entered the Army Air Corps on July 31, 1941. Kelly arrived in the Philippines in August 1941 serving with the 7th Materiel Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group. Stationed at Clark Field, near Manila on Luzon Island, the captain was made commanding officer of his squadron when the commander died in the Japanese attack on December 8. After Clark Field was evacuated to the Bataan Peninsula, he was first reported missing in action when the Japanese seized Bataan. Kelly was actually in prisoner of war camps in the Philippines, Camp O'Donnell and Cabanatuan, where he wrote a letter on December 13, 1944 to his wife telling her that he was being moved to Japan. He died December 15, 1944 in the attack on the prisoner of war transport ship, the *Oryoku Maru.* **Herschel N. Walle**r became a prisoner of war when the Japanese took Corregidor. He was serving as a private with the 27th Bombardment Group, Army Air Corps. Waller's wife, Delphine was living in Waskom when, 15 months after he was reported missing in action, she received a card through the International Red Cross telling her Waller was in a prisoner of war camp in the Philippines. In the fall of 1945 when Sendai No. 7-B POW Camp in Tokyo, Japan was liberated, Waller was one of the prisoners. He was one of 240 Americans and 40 Australians forced to work in a copper mine. Working conditions were dangerous and mistreatment a daily occurrence. Waller said that the POWs were put in 10-man work groups. They were told by their captors that if one man did something wrong the rest would be killed. In September 1945, Delphine received a cablegram with the news her husband was liberated.

    "learnMore": "During the early years of World War II, Forrest Murphey was a second lieutenant with Marshall's Company D of the Texas Defense Guard. He worked for the Texas & Pacific Railroad in Marshall while serving with the Guard.  Railroad workers were often exempted from the draft because they provided an essential service in transporting military equipment and personnel. In July 1943, at the age of 33, Murphey enlisted in the Seabees. \n\nBefore the U.S. entered World War II, the U.S. Navy was convinced they would be fighting a war halfway around the world. They knew this would present new challenges in moving, supplying and housing U.S. military forces. Beginning in 1940, they started building bases on far-flung Pacific islands using civilian contractors. When the U.S. officially entered World War II in December 1941, these civilian workers were needed in the military to fight the war.  Also, under international law, civilians could not use weapons to fight back against an enemy military attack. In January 1942, permission was given to organize a military force that would support the Navy and Marines in remote locations that could defend themselves if attacked. The Naval Construction Battalions was born. Their name was shortened to C.Bs. and then Seabees.\n\nThe earliest Seabees were recruited from the civilian construction trades. They were experienced and skilled construction workers--electricians, carpenters, plumbers, equipment operators. The average age of Seabees during the early days of the war was 37. More than 325,000 men served with the Seabees in World War II, fighting and building on six continents and more than 300 islands. In the Pacific, where most of the construction work was needed, the Seabees landed soon after the Marines and built major airstrips, bridges, roads, warehouses, hospitals, gasoline storage tanks and housing.\n\nAdapted from \"Seabees,\" U.S. Navy; Seabee Museum.

Exactly one year later, that date took on a whole new meaning for him and all our military stationed there--and all of America--as the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor brought the U.S. into World War II.\n\nIt was the dawn of a peaceful Sunday at Pearl Harbor for the young sailor from Texas.  Hollingshead remembered:\n\n\"It was about 8:00 in the morning and I stepped out the barracks door headed for the PX for breakfast.  And I heard the explosions from the hangar area that was maybe about 200 yards from the barracks. I made a left turn and made a run to the hangars and the Japanese were strafing.\" \n\nHollingshead grabbed a machine gun from weapons storage. Other men removed machine guns and ammunition out of the military airplanes that were being destroyed.  These would be needed to fight the next wave of Japanese fighters.  He said:\n\n\"We didn't have any gun mounts. One person would hold the gun on their shoulder. Another would fire the gun. We managed to knock down, I think, two planes.\" \n\nHollingshead still has a small piece of one of those Japanese attack planes, along with shrapnel from one of the Japanese bombs that left him slightly injured as he ran for cover. He even has the letter he wrote home to his mother telling her about it.\n\n\"I was hit a couple of times Sunday,\" said Hollingshead. \"But they were only grazes and I have long since healed. Something was taking care of me that day.\"\n\nHe survived, but more than 3,000 of his fellow servicemen did not. The U.S. Pacific Fleet lost battleships, cruisers, and destroyers --18 ships in all -- including the ship Hollingshead was assigned to, the USS Oklahoma. About 350 warplanes were also lost. Hollingshead would serve in the South Pacific during the war. \n\nAfter the war, Hollingshead became an engineer, worked in the East Texas oilfields and then moved to Harrison County, Texas working for Thiokol Corporation, the contractor operator at Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Karnack, Texas.\n\nAdapted from \"Cecil Hollingshead Survived Pearl Harbor\" by Gerry May, KTBS-TV, Shreveport, Louisiana."

She first served as mail clerk then trained in medicine and surgery at Hot Springs, Arkansas.  Assigned to the 5203 WAC Detachment, she served as a medical technician in New Guinea and the South Philippines. McLeroy's unit was the first WAC contingent assigned to the southwest Pacific. \n\nOver 150,000 American women served in the WAC during World War II. Members of the WAC were the first women other than nurses to serve within the ranks of the U.S. Army. The concept of women in uniform was difficult for American society of the 1940s to accept for both the public and the Army. However, political and military leaders, faced with fighting a two-front war and supplying men and materiel for that war realized that women could supply the additional resources so desperately needed. Given the opportunity to make a major contribution to the war effort, women seized it. By the end of the war their contributions would be widely heralded. \n\nOveta Culp Hobby, the former editor of a Houston newspaper and wife of Texas Governor William P. Hobby, was selected as the first director of the WAC. Colonel Hobby's dedicated and skillful administration was the primary force behind the wartime success of the organization from its formation and overall philosophy through its rapid growth and its accomplishments overseas.\n\nIn the Southwest Pacific, the need for WACs became acute by mid-1944. WACs were stationed at Hollandia and Oro Bay, New Guinea, and at Leyte and Manila in the Philippines. Women who served in this theater faced numerous difficulties, only a few of which were inherent to the geographic area. The Southwest Pacific Area Command was one of the last theaters to request and receive WACs.\n\nWACs in the southwest Pacific had a highly restricted lifestyle. Fearing incidents between the women and the large number of male troops in the area, some of whom had not seen an American woman for eighteen months, the theater headquarters directed that WACs (as well as Army nurses) be locked within barbed-wire compounds at all times, except when escorted by armed guards to work or to some approved recreation. No leaves or passes were allowed. The women chafed under these restrictions, believing they were being treated like children or criminals. Male soldiers complained frequently in their letters home that WACs were not successfully \"releasing men for combat\" because it took so many GIs to guard them. The WACs in their turn resented the guards, believing them unnecessary and insulting.\n\nMcLeroy was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Dinkle of Harrison County's Grange Hall community. They also had two sons and four grandsons serve in World War II.\n\nAdapted from The Women's Army Corp: A Commemoration of World War II Service by Judith A.

    "learnMore": "Emory Dale Slone was chief storekeeper aboard the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Pope and was a prisoner of war from March 1942 until liberated by U.S. forces in September 1945. His parents of Harleton, Texas were notified in May 1942 that he was missing in action. It would be three years before they would know his fate.\n\nIn the early days of World War II, the Pope took part in fierce fighting across the islands of the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) against the large, powerful Japanese military. In February 1942, the Pope was in port for emergency repairs at a naval yard in Java. The repairs were made and the ship waited for orders. \n\nOn February 28, with the Japanese certain to take Java, the Allies made escape plans. As the only destroyer in the fleet still carrying torpedoes, Pope, along with the British HMS Encounter, received the assignment of escorting from Java the seriously damaged, slow moving British warship, HMS Exeter. After nightfall, the three-ship convoy left port. \n\nAt 9:15 the next morning, the convoy sighted Japanese ships. The Allies engaged the Japanese with gunfire. Enemy fire rained down all around Pope, but the ships in the convoy remained unharmed and the Japanese left the battle.\n\nTwo hours later, the convoy encountered a fresh group of enemy warships and came under heavy fire. The Pope used the remaining torpedoes hitting Japanese warships. The Exeter took a direct hit leaving her dead in the water. The enemy warships closed in, bombing the ship until it capsized and sank. Soon, the Encounter, was also mortally wounded.  Now alone in the fight, the plucky Pope dashed at full speed into cover of a rainstorm, using the temporary cover to replenish ammunition and plan her next move. \n\nAt 12:15, a Japanese airplane located Pope. Six enemy planes began to dive-bomb the ship. Pope used evasive maneuvers to avoid being hit, but on the 11th attack the bomb inflicted lethal injuries. Water started rushing into the ship.  Just ten minutes after the fatal blow, the commander issued orders to abandon ship into lifeboats. The demolition crew destroyed the ship to keep its sensitive submarine sonar technology out of enemy hands.\n\nSuddenly enemy cruisers were steaming toward the Pope survivors, but just as suddenly, they left. Japanese airplanes returned and made strafing runs at the lifeboat flotilla.\n\nAll of the 152 officers and men serving on the valiant Pope were accounted for except one who died during the demolition explosions. The brave crewmen now drifted in hostile waters with limited food and water and without knowing how their ordeal might end. The wounded and sick were inside lifeboats.  The others, including Slone, were in the ocean hanging onto the edge of the balsam wood lifeboats.\n\nOn the second day after sundown, the motors were started and the flotilla moved in the direction of Java. Nearly 48 hours into their ordeal, the motor ran out of gas. Refusing to abandon hope, the determined sailors used a blanket as a sail and began rowing in relay teams.\n\nOn the third day, the Japanese destroyer Ikazuchi rescued the 442 survivors from Pope and Encounter. Many were coated in oil and some were blinded. All were hungry, dehydrated and sunburned. This humanitarian decision by Japanese commander, Shunsaku Kudō, placed his ship at risk of attack and fighting ability, because of the extra load of rescued sailors. His brave action was later the subject of a book and a 2007 television program.  \n\nThe Pope crewmen were placed in prisoner of war camps. Twenty-seven of her sailors died while in captivity. The surviving crew of the Exeter and Encounter also were prisoners of war.\n\nThe military and the world would not learn the fate of the Pope crew until the end of the war in September 1945 when the crewmen were liberated from Japanese prisoner of war camps. The USS Pope received the Presidential Unit Citation and two battle stars for her World War II service. \n\nSlone was born in Harleton, Harrison County, Texas in 1917. He served in the U.S. Navy until 1957 and returned to Harrison County.\n\nAdapted from \"Pope 1,\" Naval History and Heritage Command.

    "learnMore": "The heroic and tragic story of the \"Lost Battalion\" is a tale of bitter defeat, starvation, mistreatment, and disease, all experienced by Isaac Alvin Morgan Jr. and Granville Summerlin of Marshall.\n\nThe Texas National Guardsmen serving with the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery sailed from California November 21, 1941 with the Philippines as their destination. Onboard were Morgan, a lieutenant with Battery D, and Summerlin, a private with Headquarters Battery. On December 7, they heard the announcement over the ship's loudspeaker that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and the U.S. was now at war.\n\nThe next day the Japanese attacked the Philippines. The ship changed course to Australia.  The 2nd Battalion then received orders to move to Java, an island in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia).\n\nOn January 11, 1942, the 2nd Battalion was on Java, the only U.S. ground combat unit in the Dutch East Indies.  The battle for the island began when a large Japanese force attacked on February 27. The Americans, Australians and Dutch fought valiantly.  They were overwhelmed and on March 8 the Dutch surrendered the island. \n\n\" we ... fought ... until forced to surrender.\"\nIsaac Alvin Morgan Jr.\n\nMorgan did not mention the fierceness of the battle or how the out-numbered men fought a losing battle under deplorable conditions.\n\nThe 530 men of the 131st Field Artillery were now prisoners of the Japanese. Each POW was given a fabric number to sew onto their clothes.\n\nThe families of Morgan and Summerlin did not know the fate of their soldiers until December 1943 when they received pre-printed prisoner of war cards from the captives.\n\nHeld in prison camps in both Java and Singapore, the men were boarded onto transport ships for their destination, Japanese-held Burma (Myanmar) and Thailand.  The men were crowded into the ship's cargo hold.  Many of the soldiers were sick and injured. The commercial transport ships did not mark their vessel as carrying prisoners of war. The U.S. military attacked resulting in the sinking of one of the ships.\n\n\"I was watching the ship that was sunk during the time I was not ducking bomb fragments from the near misses our vessel received and saw it hit.  I'll never forget the sight of prisoners, mainly Dutch, jumping overboard.\" \nIsaac Alvin Morgan Jr.\n\nAfter five days on the transport ship, Morgan and his fellow prisoners reached Burma where they were forced into working parties to construct a 258-mile railroad that ran from Ban Phong Thailand to Moulmein, Burma.\n\nThe Japanese prisoner of war camps along the length of the railroad construction have been called \"the worst POW and forced-labor camps during World War II...through the almost impenetrable jungles of Thailand and Burma.\"\n\n\"We started from scratch on the railroad, even having to clear the jungle before beginning the actual construction. ... For about six or eight weeks we worked from 8 a.m. one morning until 2 a.m. the next morning, working by fires at night.  The work was especially grueling during the rainy season when rains would wash out the automobile roads.  We had to stop our work on the railroad and repair the washed-out road so that food could be brought up to us.  We got about a pound of dry rice a day, dried fish, very few vegetables and beans\" \nAlvin Morgan\n\nWorking on the railroad in Burma was a living hell.  The men were forced to work hard and long under deplorable conditions.  About half of the prisoners were sick, but were forced to work until they dropped.  Many died while the railroad was under construction.  Limited medical supplies caused disease and infection to spread.  The majority suffered from tropical ulcers, which left untreated, caused death. Malnutrition led to beriberi.\n\nSummerlin contracted malaria soon after he arrived in Burma.\n\n\"I know if it had not been for Alvin Morgan...I might not have survived. It was three or four days I was unconscious.\"\nGranville Summerlin\n\nThe prisoners were moved to a camp in Siam (Thailand) and stayed about 11 months.  Morgan said Siam was paradise compared to Burma.\n\nDuring his entire imprisonment, Morgan received only six messages from home. The first one was received in September 1944.  His mother received only three cards from her son, the first one arriving in December 1943.\n\nNews from the outside came to the prisoners over a small radio kept secret from the Japanese.  Later, the Allies sent planes over the camp to drop pamphlets printed in several different languages.  \n\nFollowing liberation of the prisoners, they wanted to make sure families, and the U.S. government, knew what happened to those who died. The men dug up records, articles of jewelry and diaries buried in graves with the bodies of prisoners who had died.  These records proved valuable in helping to identify Japanese military personnel responsible for atrocities.\n\nFor much of the time they were prisoners, Morgan and Summerlin were with Jack Yarbro of Marshall who was captured after surviving the sinking of the USS Houston off the Java coast in March 1942.  They three were liberated in late 1945.\n\nAdapted from \"Life in Prison Camp One of Hardship, Privation, Says Morgan\" by Deloise McCarty, Marshall News Messenger, October 14, 1945.

    "learnMore": "They had taken off in the pre-dawn darkness - a small squadron of fighter pilots heading out to a raid on a military camp near Bangkok in Japanese-occupied Thailand.\n\nThe pilots were excited, talking about what a good kill of Japanese airplanes they'd made on the previous day's raid. It had been so successful the squadron leader had decided to go back for another round of bombing Japanese planes.\n\nThe 2nd Fighter Squadron (Commando), 2nd Air Commando Group,10th Air Force was assigned to the China-Burma-India Theater, often called the Forgotten Theater of World War II. Of the 12.3 million Americans serving at the height of the war, only 250,000 were assigned to the CBI Theater.\n\nOne of them was 25-year-old Albert Abraham of Marshall, a captain in the U.S. Army Air Forces.\n\nAs Abraham climbed into his P-51D Mustang, he went over the events of the previous day's raid, watching the dawn as the sun broke through the horizon. It was a sight he never grew tired of seeing.\n\nThe destination was a military camp 950 miles away, in Japanese-occupied Thailand. Don Muang, a military camp outside Bangkok was one of many airfields where the Japanese had stationed planes. The raid of April 9, 1945 was one of many the U.S. Army Air Forces would make in Thailand\n\nAbraham was suited up, wearing a parachute, in the event that he had to abandon his plane or was shot down. The pilots were instructed to do whatever necessary to see that the plane was destroyed, to keep it out of enemy hands. And if the pilots were in danger of being captured, they were advised to surrender to the Thais, if possible. The Thais, who had a strong resistance movement fighting against their Japanese occupiers, had a reputation for giving their prisoners better treatment.\n\nA shot fired from the ground, during the raid on Don Muang, pierced the radiator of Abraham's Mustang combat plane that brought it down.\n\nAdrah Abraham met Abraham nearly a year after his discharge from the Army Air Forces, but she recalls Abraham's telling of the story vividly.\n\n\"The squadron leader went in too low and ground fire hit the radiator,\" she said.\n\nWhen Abraham realized his plane was going down, she said he set the plane on full throttle, aimed it toward the ground and jumped out.\n\nHe landed in a dried-up rice paddy. His foot caught in a deep crack in the dried mud, it twisted as the parachute continued to drag him. His foot swollen, he hid in some bushes near a stream, waiting until he saw some men come floating by in a flat-bottomed boat.\n\n\"He came out of the bushes and gave himself up to the Thai people,\" she said. \"He was kept as a prisoner in a British girl's school in Bangkok that had been turned into a POW camp. He said it was the best of all POW camps.\"  Abraham kept a journal during his imprisonment and release.\n\nAbraham was liberated from Bangkok Alien Internment POW Camp in the province of Pathum Thani a few months later, when the war ended.\n\nAbraham was 21 years old when he enlisted in the Army Air Corps in August 1941. (The Air Corps would later be renamed the Army Air Forces.)\n\n\"He learned to fly in Marshall … he had a Cub plane,\" Adrah said. \"He knew we would be in the war … he didn't want to be a foot soldier, so he joined the Army Air Corps.\n\nHis friend, Paul Wood, joined up as well, and the two left Marshall to report for basic training in California, driving out in a car that Wood's father, who was in the car business, provided - a Chrysler convertible.\n\nIn June 2011, a Thai rice farmer on the northern edge of Bangkok was digging up a field when he struck a large piece of metal.\n\nRealizing that it's an airplane propeller, he notified the Royal Thai Air Force, which supervised the excavation. Buried under nearly 40 feet of mud, they found the pieces of a WWII fighter plane, a P-51D Mustang.  They also found a piece of metal engraved with the airplane serial number, which led to identifying Abraham as the last pilot to fly the plane.\n\nAn American living near Bangkok began tracking down Abraham with Internet searches, knowing only his name and hometown. He found a niece in Marshall and was told Capt. Abraham had died.  Capt. Abraham's story of a long-ago airplane crash and survival became national news.\n\nExcerpt from \"A Day in the Forgotten Theater of World War I\" by Karla DeLuca, Marshall News Messenger, November 13, 2011."

He entered the U.S. Marine Corps as a naval aviation cadet in 1942 and served until his retirement in 1974.  He served in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.  Warren flew 104 combat missions in the South Pacific in World War II and 111 combat missions in Korea.\n\nAs a test pilot, Warren worked with well-known names in aviation history including Charles Lindberg, Red Blanchard, Joe Foss and Edward O’Hare.\n.\nEarly in his career, Warren experienced his first close call.  On a training mission his plane collided with another fighter pilot.  He was stuck in a fiery mass of what was left of his plan hurtling toward the ground.  He tried to eject but his legs were stuck in the fastenings of what remained of the cockpit.  His brother, Sam, was killed in a dive-bomber crash the previous year, and the thought that kept going through his mind was that his mother could not take the loss of another son. He managed to free himself and open his parachute shortly before hitting the ground.  Two workers came to where he was lying, bleeding profusely.  One was smoking a cigarette from a large package of roll-your-own Bull Durham.  Warren traded his parachute for the tobacco pouch and placed it on the gaping hole in his leg.  It stopped the bleeding. \n\nIn an air attack mission in Korea, Warren was lead pilot of a flight of four F-9-F Panther jet fighters.  Warren’s plane was struck, causing his cockpit to lose pressurization and putting a hole through his left leg.  It was necessary for his squadron to fly at high altitudes, because they were low on fuel.  This subjected him to freezing temperatures and he used the oxygen in his parachute bailout bottle to remain conscious.  Snow, ice and nightfall interfered with their visibility when they reached their landing strip.\n\nWarren decided he would land last because his plane was damaged and might crash and block the runway, preventing the other planes from landing.  The fuel supply in his plane, as well as those of his squadron, was depleted.  He circled the airport until all planes had safely landed and, with his fuel gauge showing empty, successfully landed his plane\n\nHe was awarded three Legion of Merits Combat V, three Bronze Stars Combat V, six Distinguished Flying Crosses and a Purple Heart.  He served as Commander of the first squadron of Phantoms jets, moving up through the ranks until his retirement as brigadier general in 1974.\n\nA 1941 graduate of Marshall High School, he was the quarterback of the football team. Warren graduated Summa Cum Laude from Oklahoma State University. He had three brothers who served in World War II. Two brothers died during the war.\n\nWarren's collection of aviator helmets can be seen in this exhibit in the \"Airpower\" section.\n\nSource: HCHM Archive;  Flying into Combat with Eagles by Stephen G.

Located in southeast Vietnam in the Dau Tieng District, the base of operations for both the U.S. Army and Army of the Republic of Vietnam was established in 1966. Dau Tieng was also known as Camp Rainier.\n\nVernon B. Lewis Jr., then a lieutenant colonel, was commander of the 2nd Battalion, 77th Field Artillery (2-77) that operated out of Dau Tieng. The 2-77 arrived in Vietnam in October 1966 as part of the 4th Infantry Division.  In August 1967, the 2-77 transferred to the 25th Infantry Division. They remained in Dau Tieng until 1969 when the battalion was relocated to Cu Chi where it remained until departing Vietnam in December 1970.\n\nIn March 1969, the 25th Infantry's Tropic Lightening News reported that Lewis, in addition to his commanding the field artillery in war, found an ideal method for forward artillery observers to mark enemy positions without exposing their own location. The new technique borrowed something from the past--an old M-1 rifle smoke grenade. Lewis noticed that the old M-1 grenade would fit snugly over the muzzle of an M-16. The News reported the weapon fired with a slight recoil, but was quite accurate.  The 2-77 was the first artillery unit to use this smoke grenade marker in combat in Vietnam.\n\nIn 1975 Lewis, now a brigadier general, wrote about the lessons learned by field artillery in Vietnam and that new tactics and techniques for the modern battlefield were under development by the U.S. Army field artillery. \n\nThe 2-77 participated in 11 Vietnam campaigns receiving a Presidential Unit Citation for the Battle of Suoi Tre and three awards of the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm.  The battle-scared regimental flag of the 2-77 is in this exhibit in the \"Soldiers' Stories\" section.\n\nLewis served two combat tours of duty in Vietnam.  He previously served one combat tour of duty in Korea and later served five years as Pentagon deputy chief of staff for operations.  \n\nThe son of a T&P Railroad coppersmith, Lewis was born in Marshall, Texas and graduated from Marshall High School in 1947. He attended East Texas Baptist College in Marshall before being commissioned in 1951 at the Army Ground School in Fort Riley, Kansas. Lewis obtained a Bachelor of Education from the University of Nebraska at Omaha and a Master of Science from George Washington University in Washington. He also graduated from the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk and the National War College in Washington.\n\nLewis is one of the more decorated U.S. Army field artillery officers of his generation. He has received the Distinguished Service Medal, two Silver Stars, a Distinguished Flying Cross, two Legions of Merit, the Bronze Star, two Meritorious Service Medals, 13 Air Medals, a Commendation Medal for Valor, and a number of foreign awards. Lewis' medals can be seen in the \"A Promise to Remember\" section of this exhibit.\n\nLewis retired in 1977 from the U.S. Army as a major general. \n\nSources:  HCHM Archive; Marshall News Messenger; \"Evolving Field Artillery Tactics and Techniques,\" by Vernon B.Lewis Jr., Field Artillery Journal; Vietnam Order of Battle by Captain Shelby L.

The use of helicopters was hailed as significant an advancement in moving combat troops as the change from the horse to the truck. The change was a coming together of an idea, technology, and military tactics. In the Korean War, the mountainous terrain and large number of enemy troops was presenting difficulties for the U.S. forces even though they were better trained and had superior firepower. The idea of using helicopters to move troops in combat zones was born as military officers watched small observation helicopters become ambulances evacuating wounded Marines out of Korea's steep mountains and deep valleys. They thought helicopters could be a solution to moving troops to and from combat zones that were hard to maneuver through on the ground.\n\nTechnology was making the helicopter more powerful and dependable. In the 1960s, Army engineers and technicians found a way to arm the helicopter to protect the machine and its troops as they approached combat. Helicopters and the airmobility theory was tested. Then, in July 1965 the 101st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) was activated and began arriving at An Khe, Vietnam in August. They converted the local golf course into what would become the world's largest helipad for Huey and Chinook helicopters. In Vietnam, helicopters and troops swiftly and directly moved to their objective regardless of terrain and enemy troop concentrations.\n\nSergeant Nickerson was awarded a Bronze Star with V for bravery and a Purple Heart for wounds received in action May 9, 1967.\n\nHe is a 1963 graduate of Marshall's Pemberton High School.\n\nSources: HCHM Archive;  \"Vietnam Studies:  Air Mobility,\" 1961-1971 by  Lt.

    "learnMore": "On April 7, 1965, James Wimberley Lewis led a flight of four B-57B Canberra jet bombers across the Vietnam-Laos border on a mission against enemy targets near Ban Niang in Laos.  Lewis was a pilot and a captain in the U.S. Air Force.\n\nTheir target was enemy traffic along Laos Route 7, a major artery that fed into the infamous Ho Chi Minh trail, a network of roads that ran through eastern Laos and then into South Vietnam. When North Vietnam began increasing its military strength in South Vietnam, the Viet Cong and North Vietnam regular army used Highway 7 in neutral Laos to transport weapons, supplies and troops into the war zone in South Vietnam. In the early days of the Ho Chi Minh trail, bicycles were often used for transportation through the narrow, mountainous trails. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces used all assets available to them to stop this flow of men and supplies from moving into the South Vietnam war zone.\n\nLewis and his navigator initiated an attack and then ran into clouds. Lewis radioed that his plane was \"off target and out bound.\" There was no further radio or visual contact with the crew. For six days, search and rescue missions looked for the missing crew and bomber.  They found no evidence of the two men or their aircraft. Later, U.S. intelligence reported that there were reports both Lewis and his navigator bailed out of the airplane and reached the ground alive. They were listed as missing in action.  Although the cause of the crash is unknown, enemy fire and bad weather are believed to be contributing factors.  \n \nBarbara Gillihan of Marshall and James Lewis of Mississippi married in 1952 while in college. After he joined the U.S. Air Force, they enjoyed the military life until April 7, 1965--the day he did not return from the mission to Laos. The Lewis family was stationed in the Philippines. Barbara returned to her hometown to raise her three young children and anxiously await word of the fate of her husband. For 17 years, she worked tirelessly to find out his status and wrote letters to him just in case he was a prisoner of war. Barbara became active with the National League of Families of American POWs and MIAs and journeyed to Laos in 1973 trying to learn more about the fate of her husband.  She even sued the President of the United States when the military attempted to change his status from missing to presumption of death. She lost her lawsuit and in 1982 her husband's status was officially changed from missing in action to a finding of death due to a lapse of time.\n\nIn July 1997, a joint U.S.-Laos team interviewed witnesses to Lewis' crash and they were led to the crash site. Four excavations, from 2003 to 2004, resulted in finding human remains and crew-related artifacts. Lab scientists used mitochondrial DNA to identify the remains as those of Lewis and his crewmate. Of the 88,000 Americans missing from all conflicts, 1,827 are from the Vietnam War with 372 of those within the country of Laos.\n\nBarbara Lewis' 40-year search for her husband was over. Hundreds from the Marshal community, most who did not personally know him, lined the streets waving U.S. flags as the funeral procession carrying the remains of Colonel Lewis wound its way through the town to Marshall's Colonial Gardens Cemetery.\n\nSources:  HCHM Archive; Marshall News Messenger."

Some of the tunnels were dug as early as the 1940s during Vietnam's war for independence from France. The Viet Cong used these tunnels to disappear underground to safety. The tunnels also housed troops, stored supplies, and served as field headquarters.  They were also used to lay booby traps and mount surprise attacks against South Vietnam and U.S. forces.\n  \nOn October 28, 1968, Rex Parkison decided to celebrate his 21st birthday one day early with pound cake he had saved from his food rations.  His unit, 1st Battalion of the 27th Infantry \"Wolfhounds,\" was on patrol in the Boi Loi Woods in the Cu Chi district. A fellow soldier was shot by sniper fire so the unit moved into a clearing where a helicopter could pick up the soldier.  The clearing would also serve as the night base for the unit. As the unit started settling into the clearing, Parkison began to open his cake, but set it aside when he was told to check the perimeter of the clearing along with another soldier. An enemy communications cable was discovered. Viet Cong snipers began firing and Parkison's fellow Company B soldiers came forward to assist, moving deeper into the jungle as they pursued the snipers. Then, they came upon an enemy base camp.  A furious eight-hour battle began.\n\nMany Viet Cong snipers fired from trees around the base camp. Fire came from small openings in bunkers that were connected by tunnels. The Wolfhounds' commander maneuvered the rest of the battalion against the enemy positions, but fire was so heavy that movement was slowed to a crawl. Friendly and enemy soldiers were in such close contact that supporting artillery could not immediately be called in. The battle raged under the light of flares until after midnight. During the night, contact with the enemy was broken.  Pursuit was made impossible by jungle so thick that grenade launcher fire bounced off trees. In many cases, U.S. artillery support did not penetrate the heavy jungle canopy.  The enemy abandoned their base camp before morning. When the U.S. soldiers swept the area at first light, they found an enemy base camp so extensive that the unit commander called it the most complex system of bunkers and trenches he had ever seen.\n\nWhen the Wolfhounds entered the complex of tunnels and bunkers, many documents and maps were found giving U.S. forces information about the enemy. Parkison found small silk banners of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Communist revolutionary leader, and he kept three of the banners.  He never got to eat his birthday cake.\n\nRex Parkison and his wife retired to Marshall, her home town.\n\nSources:  \"8-Hour Firefight,\" Tropic Lightening News, November 13, 1967; Interview with Rex Parkison; Vietnam Order of Battle by Captain Shelby L.

The young pilot joined the U.S. Army Air Corp.\n\nIn 1941, McClaran, a lieutenant with the 22nd Bomb Group, was the first to receive the experimental B-26 Marauder medium bomber and the first bomb group to fully deploy to the Pacific after Pearl Harbor. The 22nd, known as the Red Raiders, pioneered the flight route to Australia. McClaran was in the first, three-plane flight that left Hickam Field, Hawaii for Australia on March 28, 1942.\n\nThey arrived at Amberly Field near Ipswich, Queensland in northeast Australia on April 2.  Seven days later McClaran took off for his first bombing mission--a 500-mile flight to Rabaul, New Britain that would result in the award of an Air Medal. This new pilot with a new combat crew reached the target area without a navigator. McClaran made a bombing run through intense Japanese anti-aircraft fire at 1,000 feet. He held the bomber straight and level enabling the bombardier to score hits on the docks. Eight Japanese Zero fighter airplanes attacked. The turret gunner shot down one. McClaran and his crew were cited for \"outstanding ability, courage and devotion to duty.\"\n\nIn early May, the 22nd Bomb Group began conducting highly dangerous daily reconnaissance flights of nine hours or more, often encountering enemy aircraft. On July 17, McClaran was assigned a new B-26. His crew chief nicknamed their new bomber, \"Rose of San Antone,\" after the popular song of that time. The crew painted the nose of the airplane with a red rose. A row of bombs, painted below the pilot's window, indicated missions flown.   \n\nOn August 17, 1942, McClaran was starting the engines on his Marauder for a mission. His was one of ten bombers parked at 7 Mile Drome airfield -- fully fueled and armed with 500 pound bombs--when a surprise Japanese air raid started. Japanese Betty bombers escorted by Zeros strafed the airfield. A Japanese bomb landed about 20 yards away from McClaran and riddled his bomber with more than 50 holes. He was hit in the face and knocked unconscious. McClaran's engineer injured his ankles when he jumped off the wing, but crawled back to the airplane to rescue McClaran.\n\nMcClaran was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for one of his final missions flying out of Australia. He was returning to home field when he attacked an enemy seaplane base just established on Deboyne Islands.  After flying through extremely bad weather a bombing run was made on an enemy target. Throughout the attack, the aircraft was subjected to machine gun fire and the possibility of interception by 15 enemy seaplanes, which were circling above the target area. McClaran survived the attack and returned to base.\n\nMcClaran died November 10, 1945 in a military airplane accident in Tennessee.\n\nSources: Red Raiders Over the Pacific by Don Evans; Marshall News Messenger."

The invading North Korean Army had been superior, in both manpower and equipment, over the South Korean Army and the UN forces. The UN forces were under the command of U.S. General Douglas MacArthur. The assault of Inchon was one of the most successful amphibious operations of the Korean War.  General MacArthur said the target date of September 10, 1950 was selected because of the \"great tides\" at that time of year. The operation involved 75,000 troops and 261 naval vessels and led to the recapture of the South Korean capital of Seoul two weeks later. Harold Raines was on staff of the Espe's commander.\n\nThe Estes was designed as a floating command post.

First established for U.S. Marines to support the South Vietnamese army protecting the boundaries of the demilitarized zone, the base became a place to implement the U.S. Air Force top-secret, new way to make bombing operations more accurate.\n\nIn 1965 the Air Force had a problem in Vietnam. The long rainy season and thick, low-hanging clouds made bombing runs difficult, especially at night. The enemy Viet Cong took advantage of this problem and began launching their attacks during these times. A solution was needed.  The solution was already being used to improve the accuracy of aircrews training for bombing raids in the United States. This training system combined radar and computers near the bombing site. The system guided the bomb runs and then measured their accuracy.  This same operation would now be used in Vietnam.\n\nNamed Combat Skyspot, the units guided bombers along designated routes and signaled aircrews when to release their weapons. More than 3,000 men manned multiple locations, 24 hours a day, from March 1966 until August 1973 in South Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. They directed more than 300,000 U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine bombing flights, including reconnaissance and rescue. This performance forced the enemy to conduct daring raids to eliminate the Combat Skyspot sites or force their relocation.\n\nOn June 5, 1966, James' team left Dong Ha Combat Base to finish a survey a site to put the radar. The party had been scouting the area the previous day.  This day, Viet Cong ambushed them. There were no survivors.\n\nJames was a 1955 graduate of Marshall's Pemberton High School. \n\nSources:  \"Combat Skyspot\" by Richard A.

He was one of the many troops filling the passenger cars headed for the east coast and a steamship bound for France. There they would join other American Expeditionary Forces soldiers fighting against Germany during World War I.\n\nIn 1917, Allen left his job as an inspector with Marshall Gas Company answering a call for volunteers with the Texas Army National Guard.  After completing officers training at Camp Leon Springs near San Antonio, the young second lieutenant was assigned to the newly formed 90th Infantry. He was a platoon leader with the 345th Machine Gun Battalion.\n\nThe 90th, made up of Texas and Oklahoma guardsmen, wore a shoulder patch with a red \"T-O.\"  Their toughness in battle would lead to a new interpretation of the \"T-O\" -- \"Tough O'mbres.\"\n\nThe Americans arriving in France were shocked to see the devastation.  French citizens lost their homes, their livelihood, and their lives during the war.\n\nOn September 12, 1918, General John J. Pershing, commanding the American Expeditionary Forces, would launch its first major offensive in Europe at Saint-Mihiel, France. The German army had occupied the area since 1914. The railroad through Saint-Mihiel was important to the Allies. Saint-Mihiel lay between Paris and the eastern front. The railroad was needed out of German hands so the Allies in Paris could communicate with their troops on the eastern front. This problem had to be solved before a final Allied offensive to end the war could begin.\n\nWill and his platoon spent the night before the battle in the trenches. The opening line of the last letter Will wrote home read: \n\n\"In the front line trenches, in a dug-out, France September 11, 1918.\"\n\nThe Germans were bombarding U.S. forces, including using mustard gas. Will said the shells were dropping every thirty seconds.\n\n\"We are about ready to get into something awful.... I may get through this, but if I don't it is God's will and I am ready.\"\n\nOn the morning of September 12, the attack by the U.S. infantry and tanks was underway. \n\nWill led his platoon of machine gunners over the top of the trench. They were gassed by the Germans, but kept going. The battle continued until September 16. Will received another dosing of German gas and fell on the field.\n\nBy September 16 this area of France was liberated from German occupation.\n\nWeakened by breathing mustard gas, Will contracted pneumonia and died October 15, 1918.  He was buried in France.  In 1921, his family brought his body to Marshall's Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nSources: HCHM Archive; The Marshall Morning News, May 15, 1921; \"Today in History, The St. Mihiel offensive,\" Library of Congress; Texas Military Forces Museum archive."

The 143rd Regiment, as a part of the 36th Infantry Division, arrived in France during the early summer of 1918. Hockwald's unit was shipped by rail to an area in northeast France and served as a reserve of the French army.\n\nHockwald's 143rd Regiment was then transferred to the 4th French Army. The 143rd Infantry received its baptism of fire in an attack about 6 p.m. on October 10 when they successfully attacked the Germans near Saint-Etienne in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The next day the German army retreated to the north. The 143rd Regiment, as part of the 72nd Infantry Brigade, took up the pursuit, which resulted in the establishment of a new Allied line. The following day, the Regiment continued its relentless attack and gained control of the northern bank of the Aisne River. The Regiment maintained strong contact with the enemy until relieved by other Allied forces about October 28. The Regiment then moved to the Triaucourt areas remaining there as a unit of the 1st American Army until the signing of the Armistice on November 11, 1918.\n\nThe 143rd Regiment started returning to the United States on April 26, 1919. The Regiment spent 23 days in action, all in combat zones. As part of the 36th Infantry Division, the 143rd had total advance of 13.8 miles; total prisoners captured, 813; total material captured, three pieces heavy artillery, six pieces light artillery, 17 trench mortars and 277 machine guns. The value of enemy ammunition captured was $10 million.\n\nHockwald retired from military service as a colonel in 1943. The retired colonel and his wife, Hannah (Hirsch) Hockwald, returned to Marshall, Texas and lived in Hotel Marshall for 22 years until their deaths in the 1965.\n\nAdapted from \"143rd Infantry Regiment,\"  Texas Military Forces Museum.

A Dutch farmer attempted to hide the young second lieutenant from the Germans, but Wood was captured and sent to prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III in Sagan, Germany.\n\nStalag Luft III was miserable. Air raids, lice, bedbugs, food shortages and disease ravaged prisoners. The POWs were fed what Wood called “green death soup,” made from worm-ridden vegetables, and a flavorless flour soup with the consistency of water he called “grey death soup.” This diet was supplemented by an occasional potato and German black bread. The lack of proper nutrition caused dysentery to run rampant through the camp.\n\nOn the night of January 27, 1945, the 10,000 prisoners at Luft III were given an hour to pack their belongings and be ready to leave camp. The Russian army was pushing into Eastern Germany causing an evacuation of the POWs. The prisoners left after midnight, walking in the ever-increasing fury of a blizzard.  While traveling with ill-fitting packs, constant snowfall and near zero degree temperatures, the men dealt with blisters, sickness, and frostbitten feet and hands.  Six days and 62 miles from Sagan, the men were split into two groups. Wood’s group went on to Stalag 7A Moosberg near Munich, Germany. Three months after arriving at Stalag 7A, the 14th Armored Division of General George Patton’s 3rd Army liberated the 80,000 prisoners in the camp.\n\nStalag Luft III was the POW camp depicted in the 1963 movie, “The Great Escape,” starring Steve McQueen.\n\nPrisoners of war were brought to camps in the U.S. during World War II. The 175 main camps served over 500 branch camps with 425,000, mostly German, POWs at the end of the war. Texas had twice as many camps as any other state with 21 main camps and over 20 branch camps.\n\nWilliam Henderson Wood was born in Marshall in 1923. His brother, Perry Wood, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.\n\nSources:  HCHM Archive; Marshall News Messenger; Sally Wood Keedy; Marshall News Messenger; \"William H.Wood,\" American Air Museum of Britain; World War II Prisoner of War Database, National Archives and Records Administration; Handbook of Texas Online, Robert W.

Serving in Europe, he received five bronze battle stars for Normandy, Northern France, the Ardennes, Rhineland and Central Europe. He landed on Normandy Beach D-Day+3 and also fought in the Ardennes Counteroffensive that became known as the \"Battle of the Bulge.\"\n\nQuartermaster Corps companies provided services in combat zones. Some operated close to the front. Others provided supplies and services in a rearward position. Many times the units at the rear became involved in combat.  Assigned to the 9th Army in September 1944, the 856th along with other supply and service units at the rear were targeted by German bombers.  During the Battle of the Bulge, the Quartermaster Corps units in the rear often had to take on the role of infantrymen fighting the Germans. There were approximately 2,000 units that received the Ardennes battle star indicating they participated, in some way, in the battle.\n\nA commanding general of the 9th Army said after World War II:\n\n\"To the individual soldier I give final and highest praise. Whether in a front-line line unit ... or in a rearward position, performing hard ... tasks without glamor — it was only through his spirit, courage, and ability, working in a team with his fellow soldiers, that our armies were victorious.\"\n\nWesley received an honorable discharge on December 5, l945. The young soldier then served as a first sergeant in the United States Army Reserve.\n\nBorn in 1924, Wesley was a long-time resident of Marshall. He was a public school educator and administrator.\n\nSources:  Dora Wesley Morris; U.S. War Department General Orders; Conquer: The Story of the Ninth Army, 1944-1945 by Theodore W.

He earned one less medal than the most decorated American soldier of World War II, Audie Murphy, all by the age of 20. The only medal that he did not receive was the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nIn October 1942, Bonner and his unit were training in England--amphibious landings, shooting rifles and other warfare maneuvers. They were told it was time to ship out; they just didn't know to where. The soldiers learned North Africa was their destination 10 days after boarding a ship for the 31-day trip to Africa. \n\nWhile passing through the Cape of Gibraltar, Bonner said he realized war was approaching when he saw German flags flying over Spain.\n\nThe troop carrier landed in Oran, Algeria on November 8, 1942 where Bonner would be part of Operation Torch, a successful Allied invasion of North Africa. The build-up for Operation Torch was immense, with 24,500 men aboard 102 ships sailing from the United States and 35,000 in a convoy of over 250 ships sailing from Britain. In its first amphibious assault under combat conditions, the 16th Infantry landed on a beach near Arzew, French Morocco on November 8. Over the next three days, the regiment helped to capture Oran. In doing so, the Big Red One established a permanent presence for the US Army in North Africa. \n\nIt was in Oran on December 2, 1942, that Bonner was awarded a Silver Star. While riding on a self-propelled howitzer, at great personal risk and in face of heavy machine gun and rifle fire, Bonner saved the life of his superior officer who was seriously wounded when the vehicle became disabled and caught fire threatening to set off high explosive shells.  Bonner's heroism under enemy fire was an inspiration to his comrades.\n\nContinuing to fight with the Big Red One, Bonner participated in the D-Day invasion of France and fought the Germans across France, in the Hurtzgen Forest and at the famous Battle of the Bulge.\n\nThe 16th Infantry Regiment compiled an impressive record in World War II. In 443 days of combat, the 16th had sustained 1,250 soldiers killed in combat. An additional 6,280 were wounded or missing in action. Its men had earned four Medals of Honor, 87 Distinguished Service Crosses, and 1,926 Silver Stars.\n\nAdapted from  \"North Africa,\" 16th Infantry Regiment Historical Society.

    "learnMore": "Lloyd Donald Minter was inducted into the U.S. Signal Service on June 19, 1942. Following basic training, he was sent to Fort Hancock, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. to learn International Morse Code. He was told to go to the Pentagon for classes, but not where the classes would be held in the massive, new Washington, D.C. headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. When Minter asked for directions no one knew where the radio department was located. Minter decided to go outside and look for antenna, which would identify the location of the radio operator classes.  He found the antenna and his classroom.\n\nMinter was trained as a high-speed radio operator sending, receiving, reading and transcribing radio messages. After passing tests for speed and accuracy, Minter was sent overseas to Oran, Algeria in North Africa with the 3158th Service Signal Company, 3211 Signal Service Battalion. There he lived in an open tent with C-rations for meals and as he described, \"waited and waited\" for orders. Sent to Algiers he said, \"that's when we really started what we were sent there for.\"  It is in Algiers that he began sending and receiving messages for some of the most important U.S. generals in World War II. His company provided communications services for General Dwight D. Eisenhower in Algiers at his Hotel St. George headquarters.\n\nFollowing behind Allied forces invading Italy in September 1943, Minter's company set up operations in the Italian seaport of Brindisi. Then under the command of General Jacob L. Devers the second D-Day invasion of France, Operation Dragoon, was undertaken by the 6th U.S. Army Group in August 1944. The 6th was made up of both the U.S. 7th Army and Free French Forces. Minter's company followed General Devers setting up radio operations behind the battlefront at operation command headquarters.\n\nAfter successfully pushing the German enemy away from important French Mediterranean ports, General Devers set up headquarters in Vittel, France. Minter delivered messages to the headquarters of the 6th Army Group as they finished the Southern France campaign and launched campaigns to finish the war. Minter's company was there with Devers for over a year. The radio operators lived in the home of a French family. Radio operations were set up across the street from General Devers' headquarters in the L'Ermitage, formerly a luxury hotel and golf resort. In and out of headquarters for meals and delivery of messages, Minter likely saw some of the most important U.S. generals in the European Theater as they met with Devers about plans to defeat the weakened German enemy--Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, Joseph McNarny, and Bedell Smith.\n\nHis company continued to follow General Devers' 6th Army Group setting up radio operations in Heidelberg, Germany where they lived in an abandoned girls school. Radio equipment was set up in an open field since they no longer needed to worry about the enemy spotting their antennae and equipment--the war in Europe was over. \n\nSources:  HCHM Archive; Oral Interview of Lloyd Donald Minter, Veteran's History Project, Library of Congress; Jacob L.

McGough escaped capture in German-occupied France with the help of the Shelburne Escape Line.\n\nOn January 5, 1943, B-17 Flying Fortress bomber airplanes of the 94th Bomb Group left their base in England. Their mission was to destroy a German airfield near Bordeaux, France.  McGough, a second lieutenant, was on his ninth raid into German-held Europe on the B-17. As the bombardier, McGough made sure the bombs hit the right target. The 21 airplanes joined 112 other B-17s as they flew toward the coast of France. After dropping their bombs and turning to return to England, more than 50 German fighter airplanes attacked them.  McGough's Flying Fortress was hit breaking off the airplane's tail. They continued flying but were later hit by antiaircraft gunfire from the ground. McGough and six other crewmembers parachuted from the damaged airplane landing in German-occupied France.\n\nMcGough and his co-pilot found each other on the ground where, with the help of French farmers, they evaded capture for three days. The farmers made contact with the French Resistance, men and women of France who joined together to rid their country of German invaders, and handed the downed airmen over to their Shelburne Escape Line.  The airmen were given forged identification papers and civilian French clothing so they would not be identified as Americans. They moved along the Escape Line from one safe house to another until on March 19 they reached the rendezvous point on the English Channel. Climbing down cliffs and slipping through landmines and German beach patrols, they were picked up by rubber rafts, taken to British Royal Navy gunboats, and then transported to safety in England.\n\nThe 8th Air Force started flying bombing missions into German-occupied Europe in June 1942. Throughout the war, over 60,000 airmen were shot down over Western Europe. The French Resistance helped almost 4,000 men of the 8th Air Force evade capture.\n\nSources: HCHM Archive; Unrecognized Resistance: The Franco-American Experience in World War Two edited by Francois-George Dreyfus trans.

In a little over a year, the U.S. Army private would participate in Operation Overlord, better known as \"D-Day,\" one of the most famous campaigns of World War II against the enemy, Nazi Germany. Assigned to the 16th Infantry Regiment of the famous Big Red One (1st Infantry Division), Private Bledsoe arrived in England in time for grueling training leading up to the D-Day Invasion of German-held France.\n\nBledsoe's Company A boarded the USS Samuel Chase in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944--D-Day. A light machine gunner, Bledsoe's unit was part of the second wave to land on Omaha Beach, Normandy, France. Under heavy fire from the Germans, their company captain ordered the unit to seize the first high ground 300 yards across the beach.  Weaving their way through a minefield and anti-tank ditches they reached the high ground only to find the enemy firing on them from machine gun nests.  As night fell, Company A  had accomplished their objective with only occasional enemy sniper fire.\n\nGen. Dwight D. Eisenhower called the D-Day operation a crusade. He said, “we will accept nothing less than full victory.” More than 5,000 ships and 13,000 aircraft supported the D-Day invasion. More than 9,000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded. Their sacrifice allowed over 100,000 soldiers to begin the slow, difficult move across Europe and the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Germany.  \n\nAfter D-Day, the 16th Infantry as part of the 1st Infantry Division, pursued the retreating Germans across France in a continuous offensive. In an effort to keep up with the Germans, the men of the 16th piled on trucks, tanks, and anything else they could find to move eastward as quickly as possible. The regiment caught up with the enemy again near Mons, Belgium, where it helped destroy six German divisions in August and early September.\n\nFrom Mons, the 1st Infantry Division pushed into Germany. For the next three months, the men would experience some of the most grueling fighting of the war in the infamous Hürtgen Forest near Aachen, Germany. It was the longest battle on German ground during World War II and the longest single battle in the U.S. Army history. Bledsoe was wounded and was awarded a Silver Star for actions in this battle. Although wounded, he returned to active duty. \n\nAfter sustaining very heavy casualties from enemy artillery fire and the cold, rainy weather, the entire division was sent to a rest camp on December 12, 1944. The rest was short. Nazi Germany launched its last major offensive of the war four days later and the Battle of the Bulge started. The 1st Division was sent to support the effort on the northern shoulder of the bulge in Belgium. For the next month, the men of the 16th Infantry helped stop the German offensive. They endured heavy snows during one of the coldest European winters on record. On January 15, 1945, the Big Red One launched its part of the Allied counteroffensive to reduce the Bulge. Over the next seven weeks, the regiment conducted numerous attacks in western Germany culminating in the capture of Bonn on March 8, 1945. Continuing to push through Germany, the16th Regiment with the 1st Division was in Czechoslovakia when all enemy forces surrendered by early May 1945 and the war in Europe was over.\n\nAdapted from \"Campaigns of World War II,\" U.S. Army Center for Military History; \"World War II,\" 16th Infantry Regiment Association."

    "learnMore": "Albert Binotti was born in 1921 in Marshall.  His father emigrated to the U.S. from Italy in 1906. In October 1940, when Albert was 19, he enlisted in the Texas State Guard and was assigned to the field artillery unit of the 36th Infantry Division. Within a month the 36th was mobilized for federal service to prepare for the possibility that the U.S. would be drawn into World War II.\n\nThe 36th trained and then, when war was declared in December 1942, waited for orders to go overseas to fight. Albert was selected to attend field artillery officer candidate school.  He graduated in February 1943 as a second lieutenant. Instead of rejoining the 36th, Albert took part of a history-making experiment that resulted in his serving with what would become the most decorated Army unit in military history for its size and length of service. Albert was assigned to the 522nd Field Artillery Battalion of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team--a unit of Japanese American soldiers. \n\nA military unit of Japanese Americans was unusual because after Japan's December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans were not allowed to join the military and were even forced to resign if they were serving. Japan, Germany, and Italy were now the enemies of the United States. Americans became afraid that German Americans and Italian Americans were spies for their native countries. But it was Japanese Americans who bore the brunt of the fear. The result was imprisonment of over 100,000 men, women and children of Japanese ancestry. \n\nJapanese Americans petitioned President Franklin D. Roosevelt to allow them to serve. He agreed and Binotti, the son of an Italian immigrant, would help train and lead a field artillery company of Japanese Americans through difficult fighting in Italy, France and Germany. The 522nd was known as one of the fastest and most efficient artillery firing units in Europe and were awarded Presidential Unit Citations for extraordinary heroism in action against the enemy, Nazi Germany.\n\nJuly 4, 1944, was the first day of combat for the 522nd Field Artillery near the important Italian city of Belvedere. Backing up the infantrymen of 442nd Regimental Combat Team, the 522nd helped liberate the town from the German enemy after a hard-fought battle. The next day, at the battle for Hill 140 near Belvedere, three field artillery companies fired 4,500 rounds of ammunition in a 24-hour period. In this battle, the 522nd established its reputation as experts in time firing the 105mm Howitzer.\n\nIn October 1944, eight forward observers with the 522nd helped with the rescue of 36th Infantry soldiers surrounded by German forces. This operation became known as the \"Rescue of the Lost Battalion.\" Albert's 522nd joined the Texans of the 36th Infantry in a fierce battle in woods of the Vosges Mountains near Bruyeres, France. The Germans surrounded over 200 soldiers from the 36th. U.S. forces were having a difficult time rescuing them and decided to fire artillery shells at the Germans. The artillery unit first received incorrect information about where to aim the fire. The forward observers recognized the error. They called in corrections before any shells were fired. Later, it was discovered that if they had not noticed the mistake, the howitzer artillery shells would have fired directly at the Lost Battalion. Japanese American infantrymen, at great loss of their own lives, rescued the trapped Texans. Albert was awarded a Silver Star during the battle for the Vosges Mountains \"for skillfully adjusting artillery fire even though his own position was being shelled\" and \"his willingness to fight as a infantryman to reach suitable points of observation.\"\n\nScouts from the 522nd were among the first Allied troops to liberate prisoners on one of the death marches from the infamous Dachau concentration camp near the town of Waakirchen, Germany on May 2, 1945. Artilleryman Hideo Nakamine said, \"It is ironic that members of one persecuted minority were liberating those of another minority.\"\n\nAfter the end of World War II, Albert served in the Texas National Guard retiring as a colonel in 1981. He maintained a lifelong friendship with his Japanese-American fellow soldiers often attending their reunions.\n\nSources: HCHM Archive; Lost Battalions: Going for Broke in the Vosges, Autumn 1944 by Franz Steidl; \"522nd Field Artillery,\" denshoencyclopedia.org; 522D Field Artillery Battalion Unit History, August 1-31, 1945; \"Albert Edward 'Al' Binotti,\" discovernikki.org."

    "learnMore": "A graduate of Marshall High School, John W. Wainwright joined the U.S. Army Air Forces and received his pilot's wings in October 1943. Wainwright was assigned to the 508th Fighter Squadron, 404th \"Tin Hornets\" Fighter Group, 9th Air Force. He became known as one of America's top air heroes of World War II.  \n\nHis unit was flying out of an Allied controlled airbase in auvencourt, France. Built originally as a grass airfield by the French Air Force before World War II, the airbase in auvencourt was captured by the Germans in June 1940 during the Battle of France. The Germans developed the airfield into the largest German military airfield in France during the occupation.  More than 300 aircraft were assigned from 1940 to 1944. The airfield was seized from the Germans on September 5, 1944. The airfield became a major U.S. Army Air Forces base for fighter, bomber and transport military airplanes for the remainder of the war in Europe.\n\nThe 9th Air Force used the airfield for several units, including Wainwright's 404th Fighter Group, from September 1944 until closing the base in July 1945. Attacks on German ground forces, bridges, airfields still in German hands, railroads and any target of opportunity of the German forces were targets of the Thunderbolts as the ground forces moved east into German-held territory and crossed into Germany.\n\nWainwright's first encounter with the enemy was on September 28, 1944 over Holland. The 20-year-old lieutenant accounted for the destruction of six enemy airplanes in aerial combat against enemy forces.  While participating in a fighter sweep over enemy territory, the formation in which Wainwright was flying was attacked by a superior force of enemy fighters. Without support and completely disregarding the heavy odds against him, he attacked three enemy fighters that were making a determined attack on his flight leader. Wainwright destroyed one of them. Thrown into a spin by the explosion of the enemy fighter, he regained control of his plane and brought down three more enemy aircraft. By this time, completely separated from his formation, he encountered two more enemy planes, outmaneuvered them, and as he was getting into position to fire, the enemy aircraft collided and were destroyed.\n\nIn describing his heroism, the military record states, “Second Lieutenant Wainwright's unquestionable valor in aerial combat is in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit upon himself, the 9th Air Force, and the U.S. Army Air Forces.”   He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for this extraordinary heroism while flying a P-47D Thunderbolt fighter he named \"Flak Bait.\"  \n\nThere were no witnesses to Wainwright's single-handed destruction of six enemy aircraft on September 28, 1944, so he was not initially accorded ACE status. In 1998, his victories were finally confirmed, making him the last confirmed ACE (and an ACE-in-a-DAY) of World War II.\n\nWainwright was killed in a routine training flight on July 7, 1945 in Stuttgart, Germany.\n\nWhen Wainwright's medals were presented to his family in 1948, his father wrote the commanding general at Barksdale Air Force Base, \"You will no doubt find we are an everyday, little country family…\"\n\nSources:  HCHM Archive; Marshall News Messenger; Headquarters, U.S. Strategic Forces in Europe, General Orders No. 4 (January 8, 1945)."

His crew gave their B-24 Liberator airplane the nickname, \"Ole Satan.\"  Roy and his other crewmembers were stationed in Horsham St. Faith Airfield near Norwich, England. At its peak strength in 1944, 450,000 Americans served with the U.S. Army Air Forces in Britain. The \"bomber boys,\" as the British called them, included fighter pilots or bomber crews, but the majority worked on the ground to keep the aircraft flying.\n\nDowner, a sergeant, and his crewmates were among the nearly 30,000 who did not make it home to the United States. Downer's airplane was the first aircraft of the 458th lost on a combat mission. The March 3, 1944 mission to Berlin was recalled due to extremely poor weather conditions. Ole Satan did not return to base.\n\nHarold McDonald, navigator on another crew related the following: \"We were over the middle of the English Channel heading towards the enemy coast when Herzik [Ole Satan pilot], maintaining radio silence, signaled that he had trouble and was returning to base.  We waved to them as they left formation and continued on.  When we returned to base we were shocked that Herzik was not back yet. They must have gone down in the Channel.\" This was pilot Hezik's first mission.\n\nAmerican flight crews were based at over 100 different airfields across the United Kingdom. The construction of bases for the 8th Air Force was part of the largest civil engineering program ever undertaken in that country. Original plans called for 115 airfields to be made available to the Americans. Sixty-seven bomber bases were built for the 8th. The bases were to have three concrete runways and parking for 50 aircraft with up to three hangars, workshops, fuel storage, and an electrical generation plant. Housing for 2,500 military personnel was in the surrounding countryside.\n\nBomber crews and fighter pilots flew and fought in cold, frightening and dangerous conditions. Combat missions could take up to 11 hours in the tight, vibrating and loud airplane. They wore heated flight suits and heavy clothing to stay warm. When flying over enemy territory the crew wore steel helmets and heavy body armor for protection when attacked by enemy fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns. These, along with oxygen masks, added to their discomfort.  \n\nThe average age of the crewmen was 22. Each time their airplane took off they knew the dangers. Each airman was part of a 10 to 12 man team, bound together in the face of great danger.\n\nDowner was born in Marshall in 1922.\n\nSources:  HCHM Archive; \"Roy H.

We have been given the honor of representing our country in combat. We are here in this moment in history.  We volunteered for this day. We trained for this day. We are ready for this day \"\n\nThe Gulf War, code named \"Operation Desert Storm,\" was underway. Operation Desert Storm was a U.S.-led military coalition of nations intended to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait, which Iraq had invaded and annexed months earlier. \n\nThe 3,800-crew members on the Ranger participated in what has been called the most powerful and successful air assault in the history of modern warfare. For the next 43 days, aided by the support crews, Navy pilots took off from the Ranger attacking targets in Iraq and Kuwait. In the early morning hours on January 17, the Ranger broadcast on the ships speakers the William Tell Overture, known by many as the coming-to-the-rescue theme on the TV's \"Lone Range.,\" The Ranger crew then launched aircraft in their first mission of the war--  attacking Iraq's Umm Qasr port facility.  \n\nThe crews and aircraft of U.S. Navy Carrier Air Wing TWO were assigned to the Ranger. Four types of aircraft were onboard--the F-14A Tomcat supersonic fighter, the all-weather A-E6 Intruder attack airplane, the electronic warfare EA-6B Prowler, and the SH-3H Sea King anti-submarine helicopter. Over 3,000 flights in support of the war were made from the Ranger by the 62 aircraft.\n\nAt 9 pm EST on 27 February, President Bush declared Kuwait had been liberated and Operation Desert Storm would end at midnight.\n\nWilson was awarded the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Navy Commendation Medal, National Defense Medal, and Kuwaiti Libération Medal during the Gulf War. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1976 to 1996.  On the Ranger, he assigned the ships company (personnel) in the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department.\n\nAfter his service, Wilson was a mail carrier in Harrison County, Texas.\n\nSources:  Email interview Billy Wilson, HCHM; USS Ranger (CV 61) Operation Desert Storm Cruise Book 1990-91; Desert Storm at Sea: What the Navy Really Did by Marvin Prokrant."

When Petties arrived in Baghdad the city had suffered through over 15 years of economic hardship and war. Moving through the streets was dangerous. With their battle tank providing protection, Sergeant Petties' platoon moved through the city--house-by-house, block-by-block--seeking out insurgents.\n\nThe platoon's other assignment was to build a relationship with the community. They reached out to the citizens. The children loved soccer and needed shoes. The U.S. soldiers gave them soccer balls and flip-flops. The simple act of giving balls and flip-flops to Iraqi children built friendships and led many children to help the U.S. soldiers make their neighborhoods safer.\n\nPetties was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in Iraq. Wounded by a suicide car bomb attack while on patrol, he was also awarded a Purple Heart. He served 24 years in the U.S. Army.\n\nSource:  Marshall News Messenger."

She was a private assigned to the 7th Transportation Battalion, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Red Bull Infantry Division. Her unit deployed to Iraq and was stationed at Camp Adder.\n\nCamp Adder was the southernmost U.S. Army resupply point in Iraq. This area in south central Iraq is a dusty, middle-of-nowhere place. In summer temperatures top 120 degrees Fahrenheit. It assumed great importance in the Iraq war, with a collection of just about every kind of truck imaginable, from fuel tankers and water carriers to five-ton haulers. Taking a cue from private logistics masters like FedEx and Wal-Mart, the Army went high-tech in this war, equipping each supply truck with radio sensors that signal exactly where it is at all times. \n\nIn 2006, Guigni was awarded a Combat Action Badge for performing duties in an area where hostile actions are occurring and the recipient was actively engaged by the enemy and performing satisfactorily in accordance with the prescribed rules of engagement.\n\nSources:  Marshall News Messenger; Desert Bulls, January 15, 2007; Elysian Fields ISD website."

By 2018, he had served in over 60 countries and deployed in support of twelve named operations, including twice during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Marshall's service included Al Udeid Air Base near Doha, the capital of Qatar.\n\nFollowing joint military operations during Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Qatar and the U.S. entered into a defense cooperation agreement. In 1996, Qatar spent more than $1 billion building Al Udeid Air Base. The U.S. first used Al Udeid in September 2001. The U.S. Air Force used the then-secret base to get aircraft in position for operations in Afghanistan. By 2018, the base was home to 11,000 U.S. military personnel and housed Qatari Air Force, U.S. Air Force, Royal (British) Air Force, and other Gulf War Coalition personnel and assets.\n\nIn 2008, a U.S. Air Force Combined Air and Space Operations Center was installed at Al Udeid to provide command and control of air power across a 20-nations region stretching from Northeast Africa across the Middle East to Central and South Asia. Built at a cost of $60 million, the installation became the most advanced operations center in history. By 2018, hundreds of people worked at the Al Udeid Operations Center. They specialized in satellite communications, imagery analysis, network design, computer programming, radio systems, systems administration and other technology-related fields.\n\nMarshall was command pilot of the three-crew C-17A Globemaster III transport aircraft. The transport aircraft could carry 102 troops or paratroops, 48 litters and 54 ambulatory patients and attendants, and 170,900 pounds of cargo. \n\nMarshall is a graduate of Marshall (Texas) High School and Baylor University in Waco, Texas. In 2018 Marshall, now a lieutenant colonel, was Commander of the 97th Operations Support Squadron at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma.  As commander, he was responsible for 200 personnel that manage the U.S. Air Force training program that graduates over 2,000 C-17 and KC-135 aircraft flight crew and aircraft maintenance students annually.\n\nMarshall's personal awards and decorations include Defense Meritorious Service Medal. Meritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal, Aerial Achievement Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Combat Readiness Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and Nuclear Deterrence Operations Service Medal.\n\nLook for the \"Communications-Engineering-Transportation\" section of this exhibit to learn more about the history of the military using the newest technology.\n\nSources: \"Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey R.
